This was a multi-month project that was done with the purpose of learning! The idea was I wanted to try to copy an existing site and its functionality for a fun challenge to learn some new technologies as well as build some new UI pieces I'd never done before.

Things I learned from building are.

- Next JS. It's my first project using the framework.
- Building a carousel from scratch. This was quite a bit of work and I understand now why things like React-slick exist.
- A modal that opens a gallery of images.
- The Star reviews in the review section.
- Using the Cloudinary Javascript SDK to store images from node to the cloundary cloud.
- Solving the problem of CORS/Cookies in production.
- Many to many relationships and how to handle them in NOSQL (AKA The Reviews and Wishlist models).

Overall I thought the scope was good for an MVP and leaves room for plenty of future enhancements.
